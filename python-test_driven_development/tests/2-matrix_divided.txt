2-matrix_divided module
=======================

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
>>> matrix
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

>>> matrix = [[2.5, 5.0], [7.5, 10.0]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
[[1.25, 2.5], [3.75, 5.0]]

>>> matrix = [[1, -2], [3, -4]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, -2)
[[-0.5, 1.0], [-1.5, 2.0]]

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2], [3, 4]], "a")
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
div must be a number

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 0)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
division by zero

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], 2)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]], 2)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2], [3, "4"]], 2)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
